                <p>Underbelly is a place to anonymously report poor conditions within the hotel and restaurant industry. As many of the people who work in this industry are employed illegally they have no voice to ask for better working conditions. They are often underpaid and exploited. Injuries go unreprted, wages are below average and they are expendable. Any sign of dissent is met with termination. By giving a platform to expose shady conditions we hope to make working conditions safer and fairer while having those establishments answer for their practices in a public forum.
